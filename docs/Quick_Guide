Use the Maei_V3.sh script to generate a FASTA file of candidate effectors. 

Use the BigBlast.sh script to BLAST this set of effectors back againts your genomes. 

Use BuildTable.py to create a matrix containing the number of hits for your Maei candidate effectors 
(within the BLAST thresholds) and genomes searched. 

Use the HeatmapBuild.rmd to create a heatmap from you candidate effector matrix.
